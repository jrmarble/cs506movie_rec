# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a machine learning-powered movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their viewing preferences. The system will analyze user interactions, such as ratings, along with movie metadata to provide personalized recommendations.

## Goals
- Develop a recommendation system that predicts user movie preferences based on past interactions.
- Compare different recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models.
- Measure performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Precision, and Recall.

## Data Collection
The data will be sourced from publicly available movie datasets, such as the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset. This dataset includes:
- User ratings and interactions.
- Movie metadata (e.g., genre, release year).
- User demographic information (age, gender, etc.).

The data will be sufficient to allow for effective model training and testing.

## Modeling Approach
The project will explore multiple machine learning methods for movie recommendations:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: This technique will analyze patterns in user behavior to predict unknown preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: This approach will recommend movies based on movie characteristics (genre, director, etc.).
- **Hybrid Models**: We will explore combining both collaborative and content-based techniques to enhance recommendation accuracy.

Additional techniques, such as **Matrix Factorization (SVD)** and **Neural Collaborative Filtering**, may be explored depending on the performance of initial models.

## Data Visualization
We will use several visualization techniques to analyze the dataset and evaluate model performance:
- **Scatter Plots**: To show relationships between movie features (e.g., genre vs. average rating).
- **Heatmaps**: To visualize correlations between user preferences and movie genres.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: t-SNE or UMAP plots will show clusters of users and movies.
- **Bar Charts**: To display the most frequently recommended movies or genres.

## Test Plan
- Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- Use cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluate the models using MSE.

## Timeline
I am to complete compiling the data set and have most if not all training methods complete by the Midterm deadline. Following this, I will move on to testing the test data and reaching conclusions.
